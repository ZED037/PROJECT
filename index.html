                    The concept of total wellness recognizes that our every thought,

                A resource for everyday life, not the objective of living. Health is a
                positive concept emphasizing social and personal resources, as well as
                physical capacities.They base this definition on the idea that the
                past few decades have seen modern science take significant strides in
                the awareness of diseases by understanding how they work, discovering
                new ways to slow or stop them, and acknowledging that an absence of
                pathology pathology may not be possible.Mental and physical health are
                probably the two most frequently discussed types of health. Spiritual,
                emotional, and financial health also contribute to overall health.
                Medical experts have linked these to lower stress levels and improved
                mental and physical well-being. People with better financial health,
                for example, may worry less about finances and have the means to buy
                fresh food more regularly. Those with good spiritual health may feel a
                sense of calm and purpose that fuels good mental health.

                Health is the factor that helps a person perform his daily life tasks
                in a correct and right way. A person's physical health means that the
                body does not have any diseases in all parts of his body, and the
                safety of all its membranes. While mental and social health is
                represented by the ability of a person to accomplish social tasks
                entrusted to him without defect or error. A healthy person who is far
                from the disease sees him saving money that he would have spent on the
                disease if he neglected his health, so it is always said that "an
                ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure".Psychologically healthy
                people feel comfortable and happy in their lives and enjoy life well.
                A person who suffers from mental illnesses always sees him as a gloomy
                and pessimist and does not feel happy in his life and in his
                relationships with people. While you see a healthy person enjoying
                happiness in his life, establishing his relationships with people and
                showing love, kindness, and intimacy.
